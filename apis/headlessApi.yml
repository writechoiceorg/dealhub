      summary: Simulate a Quote
      description: |-
        Synchronously calculates quote pricing and details based on the provided configuration without creating a persistent quote object in DealHub. Ideal for real-time price calculations.

        Use this endpoint to calculate real-time pricing and quote details without creating a permanent record in DealHub. You have to inform the product and configuration data to receive the calculated line items and a financial summary. 

        To run a simulation, your request must include a `version_id` to specify which pricing and product rules to use. You also need to provide one of the following options:

        - `external_opportunity_id`: Use this to base the simulation on an existing opportunity in your CRM.
        - `geo_code` and `currency`: Use this combination for simulations that do not depend on specific CRM data.

        > 📘 Required data
        > 
        > You must provide either the `external_opportunity_id` or both the `geo_code` and `currency` parameters. Providing both in the same request will result in an error.

        Creates an official quote record in DealHub, links it to a CRM opportunity, and initiates any required approval workflows based on your active CPQ version.

        This is an asynchronous endpoint. When you send a request, the API provides an immediate response to confirm that the quote generation process has started. The full processing, including data synchronization with your CRM, happens in the background.
